# CarGame

This is the Car game.

The car avoidance game is a 2D racing game implemented in Java where the player controls a car that must avoid crashing into other cars on the road. The 
objective of the game is to travel as far as possible without crashing, with the game ending when the player's car collides with another car. 
The game features a graphical user interface with a main menu, a game screen, and a score board. The game is implemented using object-oriented programming 
principles in Java, utilizing features such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. 

The game logic is implemented using a game loop that updates the positions of the player's car and the other cars on the road, and handles collisions between 
them. The player's car is controlled using the arrow keys, and can accelerate, brake, and steer left or right. 

The other cars on the road move at different speeds and change lanes randomly, making it challenging for the player to avoid collisions. The game also includes 
power-ups such as extra lives and speed boosts that appear on the road and can be collected by the player's car. 

The game includes sound effects and background music, and the graphics are implemented using the Java 2D graphics library. The game keeps track of the 
player's score based on how far they travel without crashing, with higher scores awarded for longer distances
